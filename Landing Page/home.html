            <h2>Clear and Compelling Headline</h2>
            <p>The headline is a crucial feature of a landing page. It should be clear, concise, and attention-grabbing. It should convey the primary message or offer of the page and immediately communicate the value to the visitor. A compelling headline can pique the visitor's interest and encourage them to explore further</p>

            <h2>Call to Action (CTA)</h2>
            <p>The CTA is another essential feature. It's a clear, prominent, and persuasive button or link that tells visitors what action you want them to take. Whether it's signing up for a newsletter, making a purchase, or downloading a resource, the CTA should stand out and guide visitors toward the desired conversion.</p>

            <h2>Lead Capture Form</h2>
            <p>If the goal of the landing page is to capture user information, a lead capture form is crucial. It typically includes fields for visitors to enter their details, such as name and email address. The form should be easy to fill out and not overly complex to encourage more submissions. It's often associated with the CTA, and the data collected can be used for follow-up marketing efforts.</p>
